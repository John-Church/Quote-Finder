# Quote Finder
 
This small web scraping and parsing program was written after I found a link while inspecting the html for the flask website to learn more about building web apps in Flask. I ran across a variable called "easter egg." The variable contained the folowing link: http://fortunes.herokuapp.com/random/raw. The link is no longer active, but it used to give a different quote every time the page was refreshed. I was curious just how many quotes the website would give before one was repeated, so I built this program to grab quotes, check them to see if they had been used before, and store them all in a text file for easier reading if they were unique. It turns out there were quite a few unique quotes. In order to speed up the rate at which quotes were checked and stored, I implemented multiple threading.
